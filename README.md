- üí¨ **Intelligent Conversations**: Ask questions about uploaded images with context-aware responses
- ü§ñ **Dual AI Architecture**: Uses Ollama (llava) for image analysis and Groq for text processing
- üì± **Seamless Telegram Integration**: Easy to use through Telegram interface
- üß† **Context Memory**: Remembers uploaded images for follow-up questions

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Ollama installed and running locally
- Groq API key
- Telegram Bot Token

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/imageinsight-bot.git
   cd imageinsight-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Ollama** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   # Follow instructions at https://ollama.ai/
   # Then pull the llava model
   ollama pull llava
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ```

## Configuration

### Getting API Keys

1. **Telegram Bot Token**:
   - Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
   - Create a new bot with `/newbot`
   - Copy the provided token

2. **Groq API Key**:
   - Sign up at [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
   - Generate an API key
   - Copy the key

### Environment Setup

The bot uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file:

```env
TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

## Usage

1. **Start the bot**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Use the bot on Telegram**:
   - Send `/start` to begin
   - Upload an image to get a description
   - Ask questions about the uploaded image

## How it Works

1. **Image Upload**: When you send an image, the bot:
   - Downloads the image locally
   - Uses Ollama with the llava model to analyze the image
   - Provides a detailed description

2. **Question Answering**: When you ask questions:
   - If an image was previously uploaded, the bot uses it for context
   - Uses Groq's Llama model for text processing
   - Provides relevant answers based on the image content
